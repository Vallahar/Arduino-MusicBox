# Arduino Music Box

Little project on creating a library that can play music on arduino based on a given input of classic musical notation.

Things I'd like this to do:

- Implement basic musical notation into code the arduino can actually play.
- Be able to parse sheets.
- Be able to have midi as an input perhaps.
